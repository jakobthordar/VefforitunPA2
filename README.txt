From what we did in the class I removed node_modules, so you will have to re-install them from the package.json.

I also removed the task in grunt to concatenate and minify the javascript files - so you will have to figure that one out too in order to update the file that is being referenced in index.html

The bower components have also been removed, they can be added again very easily if you have bower set up (like you should!)

Good luck :)
